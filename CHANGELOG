* Moved Camping::Controllers::Base to Camping::Base.
* Moved Camping::Controllers::R to Camping::R.
* New session library (lib/camping/session.rb).
* WEBrick handler (lib/camping/webrick.rb) and Mongrel handler (lib/camping/mongrel.rb).
* Helpers#URL, builds a complete URL for a route.  Returns a URI object. This way relative links could just return self.URL.path.
* Base#initialize takes over some of Base#service's duties.
* ENV now available as @env in controllers and views.
* Beautiful multi-page docs without frames!

* bin/camping: an application launcher.
* <tt>Camping.run(request, response)</tt> now changed to <tt>controller = Camping.run(request, env)</tt>
* This means outputting the response is the wrapper/server's job.  See bin/camping, you can do a controller.to_s at the least.
* <tt>Controllers::Base.env</tt> is the new thread-safe home for <tt>ENV</tt>.
* The input hash now works more like Rails params.  You can call keys
  like methods or with symbols or strings.
* Queries are now parsed more like PHP/Rails, in that you can denote
  structure with brackets: post[user]=_why;post[id]=2
* Auto-prefix table names, to help prevent name clash.
* Helpers.errors_for simple validation.
* Lots of empty :href and :action attributes, a bug.
* New single-page flipbook RDoc template.
